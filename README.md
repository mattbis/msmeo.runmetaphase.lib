.. most of the extremely crazy arch i was thinking about; teh reason I like it is reducing the amount of code that deals with this.. into abstracts that are powerful... ( albeit somewhat obtuse to use at first )

they are almost like hooks.. 

defs stack, run until destroyed, selectors have to be explicit and enabled.. but very powerful..
