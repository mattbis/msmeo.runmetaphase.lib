### swift reasoning without reading the previous public source...  testing my memory

.. most of the extremely crazy arch i was thinking about; teh reason I like it is reducing the amount of code that deals with this.. into abstracts that are powerful... ( albeit somewhat obtuse to use at first )

they are almost like hooks.. since they allow somebody to modify it with a modicum of knowledge and hook into the various things... most are like preprocessors.. 

defs stack, run until destroyed, selectors have to be explicit and enabled.. but very powerful.. 

i like making extremely configurable things... so you could entirely redefine parts of the tool logic easily...
